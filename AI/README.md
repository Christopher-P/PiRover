## AI
Training should not take place on the raspberry pi. This is because it will take a long time to train (not best proccessor).

## Training
Training the Keras AI is done in new2.py. Training is currently based on a set of image, action pairs generated by me driving the rover around campus.
The script will export a model file (hdf5 format) that can be used to recreate the trained model on the pi. It should be as simple as:

import h5py
with h5py.File('input/file.hdf5', 'r') as f:
    x_data = f['x_data']
    model.predict(x_data)
